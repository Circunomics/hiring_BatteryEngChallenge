# Data Science Challenge

The following Stanford [dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/publications.matr.io/1/final_data/FastCharge.zip) contains data from Li-Ion batteries that have been continuously charged and discharged:


## Task

Based on the datasets, a prediction should be made for the development of the Discharge Capacity.

Please prepare the following tasks:

Follow these steps:

1. Reading the data into e.g. JupyterLabs

2. Clean + visualize the data

3. Selection of possible ML models

4. Reasoned decision for a ML model


## Thinks to keep in mind:


Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at Circunomics. 

This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

What is important here, is that you don't need to implement everything in the deepest detail.

The point is to understand how you set up your data science approach and which packages you use and how you communicate and present your work processes.
