# Data Science Challenge

The following Stanford [dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/publications.matr.io/1/final_data/FastCharge.zip) contains data from Li-Ion batteries that have been continuously charged and discharged:


## Task

Based on the datasets, a prediction should be made for the development of the Discharge Capacity.

Please prepare the following tasks:

Follow these steps:

1. Reading the data into e.g. JupyterLabs

2. Clean + visualize the data

3. Selection of possible ML models

4. Reasoned decision for a ML model


## Thinks to keep in mind:


Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at Circunomics. 

This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

What is important here, is that you don't need to implement everything in the deepest detail.

The point is to understand how you set up your data science approach and which packages you use and how you communicate and present your work processes. 

## How to submit the challenge solution?

Now after you finished the challenge, please push your code and reasoning (in markdown as README.md) to your repo account, if so please follow the instructions below:

1. Set the Repo privacy: 

	a. If the repo is sensitive and you're not comfortable sharing it publicly please tell us where you are going to push the code and we will provide you with an user that you can give access to. 

	b. If it's public go to the next step

2. Send the repo's link to this email: jobs@circunomics.com
